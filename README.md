# Machine-Learning
Eric's Fun with various flavors of machine learning on Arduino and other microcontrollers to Raspberry Pi. It is now possible to run ML directly on microcontroller hardware using only
kilobytes of memory.  The Arduino Nano 33 BLE is directly sported as well as Pi


## Hardware Used:

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Cortex M4F https://amzn.to/36bWdsy

- Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 Dual-core ARM Cortex M0+ Processor: https://amzn.to/2LUCtCN

- Learning Textbook TinyML https://amzn.to/2YfcBnC

# TFLite Micro

### This directly supports the Raspberry Pi Pico!!!  

### Supports microcontroller devices.  

TF Lite Micro Git repo for the Raspberry Pi Pico https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-tflmicro

The TensorFlow website has information on training, tutorials, and other resources. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers

The TinyML Book is a guide to using TensorFlow Lite Micro across a variety of different systems. https://tinymlbook.com/

TensorFlowLite Micro: Embedded Machine Learning on TinyML Systems has more details on the design and implementation of the framework. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08678.pdf
