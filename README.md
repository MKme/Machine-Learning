# Machine-Learning
Eric's Fun with various flavors of machine learning on Arduino and other microcontrollers to Raspberry Pi. It is now possible to run ML directly on microcontroller hardware using only
kilobytes of memory.  The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Cortex M4 is directly sported as well as the RP2040 from Raspberry Pi foundation.  

It seems the Arm/Cortex processors support ML 

The hardest part for me has been understanding what the different machine learning softwares did and what hardware they are meant for- I have summarized this for you right here in the readme! 



## Hardware Used:

### Arduino Nano 33 BLE Cortex M4F 3.3V logic and supports Wifi
Buy Nano 33 on Amazon  https://amzn.to/36bWdsy
Voice recognition with Nano:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRSVQ4Fkwjc&ab_channel=Digi-Key


### Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 Dual-core ARM Cortex M0+ Processor: 

Most of my Pi Pico notes can be found in my Raspberry Pi Repo here:  
Buy the Raspberry Pi Pico here: https://amzn.to/2LUCtCN

# Edge Impulse 

Can use your phone, Arduino or other dev board to do very small size neural net and model.  Nice web GUI and FREE usage for dev. Often promoted by Hackster.io with great videos and coverage
Supports:
-     Arduino 
-     C++ library
-     AND STM32Cube.AI (STM board)

- Interesting Seminar video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9SNqDejOB0&ab_channel=tinyML


# Tensor Flow
 
Grandad of machine learning requiring significant hardware for learning and running

- Will use this on the Pi robot/rover for vision analysis

- My Robot Builds/Playlist on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4qu3vGrniQ&list=PLxyM2a_cfnzjRXpokx_aADmTFS94OSxGf&ab_channel=MKmeLab


# TFLite 

TFLite is for mobile and IOT devices

- Web:  https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/


# TFLite Micro

Supports:

-     Raspberry Pi Pico 
-     Unknown other devices. Unclear what is needed for installs/support on PC


- TF Lite Micro Git repo for the Raspberry Pi Pico https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-tflmicro

- The TensorFlow website has information on training, tutorials, and other resources. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers

- The TinyML Book is a guide to using TensorFlow Lite Micro across a variety of different systems. https://tinymlbook.com/

- Eric bought the TinyML Book https://amzn.to/2YfcBnC

- TensorFlowLite Micro: Embedded Machine Learning on TinyML Systems has more details on the design and implementation of the framework. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08678.pdf

# STM32Cube.Ai

STM32Cube.Ai can be run alone or better yet- it is included in Edge Impulse above!!! Handy it can be used to compile for STM right from the web interface. It looks like it might only support 
one board- ST iot discovery kit?  Need to look in to this.
