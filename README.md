# Machine-Learning
Eric's Fun with various flavors of machine learning on Arduino and other microcontrollers to Raspberry Pi. It is now possible to run ML directly on microcontroller hardware using only
kilobytes of memory.  The Arduino Nano 33 BLE is directly sported as well as Pi

Nano 33 BLE I use in videos https://amzn.to/36bWdsy



### TinyML

Eric bought the TinyML Book https://amzn.to/2YfcBnC

Interesting Seminar video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9SNqDejOB0&ab_channel=tinyML


### Edge Impulse 

Can use your phone, Arduino or other dev board to do very small size neural net and model

### TFLite 

TFLite is for mobile and IOT devices

Web:  https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/



### TFLite Micro

This directly supports the Raspberry Pi Pico!!!  
TF Lite Micro Git repo for the Raspberry Pi Pico https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-tflmicro

The TensorFlow website has information on training, tutorials, and other resources. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers

The TinyML Book is a guide to using TensorFlow Lite Micro across a variety of different systems. https://tinymlbook.com/

TensorFlowLite Micro: Embedded Machine Learning on TinyML Systems has more details on the design and implementation of the framework. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08678.pdf

### Tensor Flow
 
Will use this on the Pi robot/rover for vision
