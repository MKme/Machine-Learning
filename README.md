# Machine-Learning
Eric's Fun with various flavors of machine learning on Arduino and other microcontrollers to Raspberry Pi. It is now possible to run ML directly on microcontroller hardware using only
kilobytes of memory.  The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Cortex M4 is directly sported as well as the RP2040 from Raspberry Pi foundation.  

It seems the Arm/Cortex processors support ML 

The hardest part for me has been understanding what the different machine learning softwares did and what hardware they are meant for- I have summarized this for you right here in the readme! 



## Hardware Used:

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Cortex M4F https://amzn.to/36bWdsy

- Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 Dual-core ARM Cortex M0+ Processor: https://amzn.to/2LUCtCN

- Learning Textbook TinyML https://amzn.to/2YfcBnC

# Edge Impulse 

Can use your phone, Arduino or other dev board to do very small size neural net and model.  Nice web GUI and FREE usage for dev. Often promoted by Hackster.io with great videos and coverage

- Good Vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYq6VgXeYwc&ab_channel=Hackster.io

- Another Good Vid:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUre8L9DK-8&ab_channel=Hackster.io


# TinyML

This seems to be the basis/compiler for some others possibly.  Few working examples in the videos 

- Web: http://tinyml.org

- Good YouTube channel with full length videos https://www.youtube.com/c/tinyML/videos

- Forum https://forums.tinyml.org/t/welcome-to-tinyml-forums/7

- Interesting Seminar video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9SNqDejOB0&ab_channel=tinyML


# Tensor Flow
 
Grandad of machine learning requiring significant hardware for learning and running

- Will use this on the Pi robot/rover for vision analysis

- My Robot Builds/Playlist on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4qu3vGrniQ&list=PLxyM2a_cfnzjRXpokx_aADmTFS94OSxGf&ab_channel=MKmeLab


# TFLite 

TFLite is for mobile and IOT devices

- Web:  https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/


# TFLite Micro

### This directly supports the Raspberry Pi Pico!!!  

Supports microcontroller devices. Unclear what is needed for installs/support on PC

- TF Lite Micro Git repo for the Raspberry Pi Pico https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-tflmicro

- The TensorFlow website has information on training, tutorials, and other resources. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers

- The TinyML Book is a guide to using TensorFlow Lite Micro across a variety of different systems. https://tinymlbook.com/

- Eric bought the TinyML Book https://amzn.to/2YfcBnC

- TensorFlowLite Micro: Embedded Machine Learning on TinyML Systems has more details on the design and implementation of the framework. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08678.pdf

# STM32CubeAi

Seems the STM32 does have support (or did in Q4 2019)
